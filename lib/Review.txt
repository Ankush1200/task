1. Issues(Why Count variable get resets when someone scrolls the page):-
    ListView.builder reuses widgets
    when they scroll in and out of view, which improves speed. This implies that anytime your ListItemWidget
    scrolls in and out of view, it is rebuilt and its state, represented by the count variable, is reset.

2. Solution(To hold the stateof the count variable when someone scrolls the page or not):- 
    To persist the state of each ListItemWidget, you should consider storing the count values outside of the 
    widget itself, such as in a list or a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, etc.). 
   
3. Changes that have perform in order to Change the file:- 
    final List<int> countsList: Declares a final (immutable) list of integers named countsList.
    List<int>.generate(100, (index) => 0): Uses the generate constructor of the List class to
    create a list with 100 elements. 
    
    The generate function takes two arguments: The first argument (100) is the length of the list. The
    second argument is a function that takes an integer index and returns the value for that position 
    in the list. In this case, the function (index) => 0 returns 0 for every index, initializing all 100 
    elements of the list to 0.
